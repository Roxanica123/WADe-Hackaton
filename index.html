<h1>Exercise 1</h1>
We read about <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">https://musicbrainz.org/</a> to get familiar with the terminology and tried to reproduce some triples.
This part was implemented by Milea Robert.
<h1>Exercise 2</h1>
We used the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint and <a href="https://dbpedia.org/sparql/">query editor</a> for writing and performing queries.
We started from analyzing DBpedia pages such as <a href="https://dbpedia.org/page/Guitar">the guitar page</a> to find properties that we can use 
such as the "is dbo:instrument of" property for the guitar. 
The queries were written by Irimia Roxana (2a,b,c) and Milea Robert (2d).
